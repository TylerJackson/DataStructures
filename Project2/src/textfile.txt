I like fire-trucks because they are cool They
have giant water-hoses and ladders and tires
that can put out fires
[2]
When there aren't fire-trucks the fire burns
down your house Fires get up to a temperature
of 1000 degrees
[3]
If your house burns down you lose all your
things which can be sad
[4]
However usually people have insurance
that protects
them from losing
any money in theory
